# Myportfolio
This is a clean and simple personal portfolio website made using only HTML and CSS,to make the experience better. It is designed to help anyone present their personal and academic information in a neat and professional way.

The website is divided into different sections such as Home, About, Education, Projects, and Contact. These sections can be easily accessed through a navigation bar that stays at the top of the screen as you scroll. The navigation bar makes it easier to explore the site.

The design uses a soft and modern style with a slightly transparent effect and subtle shadows, which gives the site a calm and polished feel. It also includes a personal image at the top, followed by details that help visitors learn more about you.

This website works well on different screen sizes, including mobile devices, thanks to its responsive layout.
